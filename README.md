# Maze solver

This project originally started as a developer challenge at my former work. It was written in JavaScript and could solve mazes that were generated by an external site.

I decided to do a rewrite in TypeScript. Now the maze is generated by itself and can be rendered in text or on a canvas.

A demo can be found [here](https://whispering-atoll-62005.herokuapp.com/).
