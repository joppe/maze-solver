# Maze folver

This script is my solution of the "dev-challenge" at [work](https://zicht.nl). The goal was
to create a script that can solve a maze that is generated by the site [hereandabove.com](http://www.hereandabove.com).
The developer was free to choose the programming language he wanted to use.

I chose "JavaScript". Since I did not use `Promises` and `Workers` before, my personal goal was to get a better understanding those objects.


## Prerequisites

`make`, `node` and `npm` should be available to run the script. Also a webserver with support for `php` should be available.


## Usage

Run `make setup` and browse to the `index.html`. On each refresh a new maze is fetched and solved.
